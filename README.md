# 📃⏳ Achill // Track your time

Web app to help you fill out Troi. Uses the [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) framework and the [Troi API](https://v2.troi.dev/).

#### 👉 Also check out our other in-house self-built Slack bot for Troi: [BleibTroy](https://github.com/digitalservice4germany/troi-slack-bot)

## Setup Troi

Three things need to happen in your Troi account (it might already be set up correctly):

- If your Troi user was created after the 15th of February OR if you have change your Troi password after this date, you will only be able to login with the API v2 token, which will need to be re-generated: "Troi --> Menü --> Mitarbeiter --> Sicherheitscenter --> Persönliche Zugrifftokens --> API v2 / Troi App --> Erneuern"
- your account needs write-access to the Troi-API, Lisa S. can make that happen as a Troi admin (test: if you can log into this web app you're good)
- you need to mark your project(s) as favourite, only those will be accessible within Achill and BleibTroy:

```sh
npm install
```

```

## Docker

The project is run on k8s with a container, therefore it can be build locally and tested.

```sh
# build the container
docker build . --tag achill
# run the container
docker run -p 3080:80 -it --rm achill
# now it is accessible at http://localhost:3080
```
