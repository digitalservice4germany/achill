# üìÉ‚è≥ Achill

Web app to help you fill out Troi. Uses the [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) framework and the [Troi API](https://v2.troi.dev/).

#### üëâ Also check out our other in-house self-built Slack bot for Troi: [BleibTroy](https://github.com/digitalservice4germany/troi-slack-bot)

## Setup Troi

Two things need to happen in your Troi account (it might already be set up correctly):

- your account needs write-access to the Troi-API, Lisa S. can make that happen as a Troi admin (test: if you can log into this web app you're good)
- you need to mark your project(s) as favourite, only those will be accessible within Achill and BleibTroy:
